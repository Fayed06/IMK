            <h3>"Dota 2 is a competitive, fantasy MOBA and is the successor to the incredibly popular Warcraft 3 custom map. Dota 2 features a standalone client, a brilliant musical score, and a huge cast of heroes."</h3>
            <br>
            <h2>Overview:</h2>
            <p> Dota 2 is the successor to the original Dota and features polished graphics, smooth gameplay, and an excellent amount of variety (heroes, game modes, and skins). Despite the steeper learning curve than other MOBAs, Dota 2 appeals to a broad
                audience and is one of the most popular and widely played MOBAs in the world. The game was developed by IceFrog, the the same designer behind the original Dota. Gameplay-wise, Dota 2 plays exactly like the first game, except with a lot
                more polish given the new engine and stand-alone client.
