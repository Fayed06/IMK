            <h1>PUBG: New State arrives on iOS and Android on November 11th</h1>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htld_r86pfI"> </iframe>
            <p> PUBG: New State, the upcoming free-to-play mobile game, will release on iOS and Android on November 11th, its publisher Krafton announced today. The game is set in the year 2051, and will offer a futuristic take on the multiplayer-focused PUBG formula with new features like weapon customization and in-game drones. 
                New State will be available in over 200 countries and 17 languages at launch.

            </p>
            <p> New State is a significant launch for the PUBG series, which popularized the battle royale genre after the launch of its first title in 2017. Although New State isn’t its first mobile entry, following the launch of PUBG Mobile in 2018, it’s the first to have been made by the game’s original developer, PUBG Studios. 
                Development of the original PUBG Mobile was handled primarily by Chinese tech giant Tencent.

            </p>
            <p> “STRONG ANTI-CHEAT” MEASURES HAVE BEEN PROMISED"
                PUBG Studios emphasizes that New State will come with “strong anti-cheat” measures at launch, and that the company will be actively monitoring the community to catch problems before they grow too widespread. The PUBG games have had big problems with cheaters in the past, with Motherboard reporting earlier this year 
                that one cheat-making group allegedly made over $70 million selling cheats for PUBG Mobile. PUBG is far from the only game to have had these problems, however. Other companies like Activision and Valve have made news recently with their efforts to prevent cheating in their games and hardware, respectively.
                

            </p>
            <p> Like previous PUBG games, New State is centered around multiplayer matches. Up to 100 players enter a map, and one player or squad emerges victorious. There’ll be four maps available at launch in New State, including franchise staple Erangel, and PUBG Studios is promising to regularly update it with new content over time.


            </p>
            <p> Away from mobile, Krafton plans to release another PUBG-related game for PC and consoles by next year, Bloomberg reported in January. There are also plans for a new survival horror game set in the PUBG universe three centuries in the future, which will release in 2022.
